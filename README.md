# Talentflow

Talentflow is an employee management system built with NextJS, designed to streamline HR processes and enhance employee engagement. It leverages Artificial Intelligence to provide powerful features for talent management.

## AI Features

Talentflow incorporates several AI-powered features to assist with HR tasks:

- **Attrition Risk Analysis:** Predicts the likelihood of employees leaving the company.
- **Employee Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes employee feedback to gauge overall sentiment and identify areas for improvement.
- **Smart Candidate Matching:** Matches job applicants with suitable open positions based on skills and experience.
- **Generate Job Descriptions:** Assists in creating comprehensive and attractive job descriptions.

## Project Overview

Talentflow is built as a NextJS application and is compatible with Firebase Studio and Project IDX, providing a development environment optimized for building and deploying web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Firebase Studio

Firebase Studio, an extension within Project IDX, offers a powerful environment for developing and managing your Firebase projects. While Talentflow is designed to integrate with potential future Firebase backend services, Firebase Studio can also be used for general web development within Project IDX.

## Project IDX

Project IDX is a browser-based development environment that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for building full-stack applications. It offers a convenient platform for developing Talentflow.

## Using with Existing Projects

Firebase Studio can be used with existing Firebase projects. Simply open your project in Project IDX, and the Firebase Studio extension should be available.

## Using Firebase Studio without other Firebase services

While Firebase Studio is designed to integrate with Firebase services, some features might be accessible even if you are not using all of Firebase's offerings. However, its full potential is realized when working with a Firebase project.

## Next Steps

*   Explore the [Firebase Studio documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio) to learn more about its features.
*   Start building your application by modifying `src/app/page.tsx` and other relevant files.
*   Integrate additional Firebase services as needed for your project.
